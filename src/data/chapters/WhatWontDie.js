    content: `The Firelands went on and on and on.
              So did Shikamaru, Ino, Chōji, and Kakashi. They chased without pause; three days and three nights now; pushing themselves to catch the two Akatsuki who had taken Naruto amid the chaos in Konoha. When they stopped, it was for no longer than three hours, with a rotating watch. When awake, they maintained pace.
              It was grueling. Easily the hardest tempo Shikamaru had ever forced himself to keep. But it was necessary; unless they were faster than their prey, it would all be for nothing and Naruto would be gone. Dead. The terrain would eventually open; they were nearing the Land of a Hundred Rivers which ran from the northern canyons and valleys. Shikamaru had held onto hope that they would catch up before they reached the border to Earth. It was ambitious – recklessly so – but possible. 
              By the third day, Shikamaru could do little more than trust this initial assessment was accurate, even as his brain turned against him. Screeching, wracking. Wandering, stalling, looping. Fatigue could subtly and insidiously unseat even the most rigorous logic. 
              Weaving through the canopy – Kakashi at their head – Shikamaru had to force his focus over and over. Gaps were forming; missing moments, seconds unaccounted. Was it malfunction or monotony? The Firelands had little variation. No anchor. They just went on and on and on.
              They pressed past sunset, then farther still, despite mounting complaints from Ino. Chōji endured, but Shikamaru knew he tired. The concern was justified; their pace was downright dangerous. They could not sustain this for much longer.
              Under a bright moon and quiet forest, they finally settled beneath a board tree, shaded and defensible. Chōji went to refill all their canteens and waterskins in the nearby creek.
              “Let me scout ahead,” Ino said, working to slow her breathing. She would need rest as soon as it could find her, and it wouldn’t until her pulse fell.
              “Save it for tomorrow,” Shikamaru said. He took the waterskin from Chōji and drained it in a single pull. “The forest is still too thick. You said it opens up just ahead.”
              “Right…” Ino conceded. They’d been over this. “Sorry. It’s hard to think.”
              Kakashi nodded, just enough to get Shikamaru’s attention. Shikamaru trained his eyes upward, into the lattice of branches above them. With the moon and stars providing just enough light, he saw what he had been watching for.
              A mask. 
              Kakashi had been the first to spot it two nights prior, and then again the night before. Fortunate. Or rather, fortunate for Shikamaru to have someone like Kakashi on his team; he doubted he would have caught it without knowing precisely what to look for. Since then he had stolen glances whenever he dared, careful not to betray awareness. If the enemy learned their surveillance had been noticed, they might alter the patterns. 
              Again, Kakashi had caught the mask before Shikamaru had.
              The mask drifted, hovering, then turned and slid away. Back to where it had come from, presumably. 
              “I’m starting to forget things myself,” Kakashi said mildly. “Did we eat our rations?”
              Ino flicked him a wrapped strip of jerky. “I’ll take the first watch, right?” she said. “Chōji the second?”
              “Yes,” Shikamaru replied. “Get some rest. All of you.”

              The nights were cold, but the dawn warmed. Kakuzu kicked Hidan awake and they were moving again.
              “They’re catching up,” Kakuzu said as they threaded the branches – fast, but not fast enough. Damn apes. “My suspicion was correct. They’ll catch us before the border.” It was too clean. They were being undercut on rest by the thinnest margin imaginable. Kakuzu had tried to determine how they kept eyes forward, but he hadn’t yet. Whatever technique they used, he didn’t recognize it. 
              The kunoichi was doing something, that much he was certain of.
              Damn it all.
              Hidan yawned, long and exaggerated. “So what do we do?” he asked. “Because if you tell me just once more to push–”
              “We fight,” Kakuzu cut in. 
              He had not wanted to, but they had exhausted every other alternative. The Konoha-nin had numbers and terrain on their side; risk needed to be mitigated wherever possible. “But not in the forest. There’s a clearing ahead.”
              “Finally,” Hidan said, cracking his neck as his energy magically returned. 

              “I saw them,” Ino said as she snapped back into herself. The shintenshin no jutsu – mind body switch technique – had been mercifully quick this time. After leaving the swallow, Ino hadn’t drifted long before finding her body. “They’ve stopped in a moor that’s very close,” she continued. “They’re… waiting.”
              “Good,” Kakashi said. 
              He didn’t hesitate. He pulled the hatchet from his pack and set to the nearest tree that was long and thick enough to serve. Two clean cuts; two logs of equal length. Shorter than himself by roughly half, but close in mass. 
              Chōji and Ino worked together to bind her arms, using sticks to separate and brace her elbows so she could maintain the tiger seal. She was settled against the trunk of a tree as Chōji gently drew her chakra-form free. He held her physical hands until spiritual ones reached out to grab hold.
              “Careful – slow down!” Ino warned as Chōji drew her farther and farther from her body, her translucent hands dangerously close to phasing straight through his. It took a sharp burst of focus to hold on. “Okay, faster,” she said once her grip was secured again.
              “Ready?” Kakashi asked once she was fully out. 
              The formation was simple: Chōji; log; Ino; tree. If the encounter turned ugly, this line would keep their opponents sweating.
              Ino nodded, testing the balance of her two kunai. Anything more was too much to manage.
              “Let’s go,” Kakashi said. Then they moved.
              “And trust the plan.”

              Exactly as Ino had reported, the two Akatsuki were waiting just beyond the treeline. The clearing was sunken and barren. Dust lay thick across uneven ground, broken by jutting roots that burrowed and coiled like the remnants of something massive and long dead. The tangle was densest along the low cliffs that ringed the moor; particularly on the right-hand rock face.
              A  mild breeze slid through the basin.
              Kakashi and Ino arrived side by side. Kakashi with his log in hand, Ino with her kunai.
              Kakuzu rose from the root where he had perched. His black-and-red cloak flagged once in the wind. “Let us get this over with,” he said.
              “Why, do you have somewhere to be?” Kakashi asked.
              Kakuzu did not laugh. “Hidan. Handle the girl.”
              “Bah!” Hidan scoffed. He was not at all hurried; he stood leisurely, resting against his enormous sanjin no ōgama. “The small fry for me?”
              “They were four,” Kakuzu continued, eyes never leaving Kakashi. “Something’s amiss. Stay alert. And don’t dally.”
              Hidan stretched his back, then his leg. “Whatever you say.”
              Kakuzu’s robes began to swell. The fabric strained. Something shifted beneath the black cloth. Bubbling. Brewing. Snaps and tears sounded. When the masks emerged, they trailed viscous strands of dark filament. Their mass grew, twisting and knitting together into two hulking forms.
              The first to crawl out – reaching with sharp claws to grip the dirt – was a compact, hunched creature bristling with tendrils ending like rigid spikes, its porcupine mask fixed in a perpetual snarl. The second was thinner and taller. When it straightened, it loomed nearly twice Kakuzu’s height. The mask had a lamprey-like mouth, a distorted oval lined with curved teeth.
              What on earth… 
              Kakashi had never before seen a technique like this. Puppets?
              He did not have time to further assess. 
              Hidan charged, scythe rising for the opening cut.
              Ino moved to meet him head-on.
              Four shuriken flashed from Kakashi’s hand toward the thread-creatures. The taller one – the lamprey – didn’t bother to evade. It bent, twisted, the mask clacking as its round maw opened wide. Water detonated outward in a dense, screaming jet, swallowing the shuriken whole and letting them scatter harmlessly.
              Defense and offense in one.
              The column was aimed at Ino. She only had a heartbeat to read it. Flicking her kunai high, she let the water strike her dead-center; then she emerged through it unharmed, colliding with Hidan an instant later. His scythe cut straight through her; her form flickered, reformed, and she caught her falling kunai as she passed him.
              Hidan pivoted and swung again.
              The second thread-creature, the porcupine, came leaping at Kakashi, fire building in its throat. It hit the ground hard and exhaled an inferno, sweeping side to side to deny space. Kakashi leapt clear, the heat blooming beneath him.
              Behind him, the lamprey wound like a music box, its body tightening as water compressed for release. Kakashi had nowhere to go; fire below him, water imminent. The jet came fast, a solid pillar dense enough to pulverize stone.
              Right before it impacted, Kakashi signed tiger; deer and vanished. The log took the hit instead, struck at an angle and flung end over end. It crashed through the roots near the cliff, bouncing wildly before disappearing. 
              Kakashi landed hard but intact. The exchange hadn’t been planned, but the log had been close. 
              The porcupine didn’t slow. It barreled through its own flames, smoke trailing from its quills, fire already reigniting. Kakashi read the posture, the tension in its frame, and prepared to evade.
              The blast didn’t arrive.
              “What are these things?” Shikamaru called from the forest’s edge. He was signing tiger; his shadow extended to the porcupine’s, snaring it mid-breath. It locked in place, fire dying in its throat.
              Shikamaru could bind them. Normally, constructs were exempt from kagemane. 
              Not these.
              The hold lasted only a moment. A water blast from the lamprey tore across the ground, forcing Shikamaru to disengage and break the link.
              Kakashi didn’t waste the generous opening.
              He drove forward, closing the distance to Kakuzu before the masks could recover. Kunai flashed. Kakuzu snapped backward, threads twitching beneath his robe as he gave ground.

              The scythe passed cleanly through Ino again. All she had to do was keep her hands clear so her kunai wouldn’t be knocked from her grip. Hidan swung once more; then again, and again. Relentlessly, he drove her back.
              Ino flipped away to buy space, light as a drifting leaf, and landed atop an enormous root. The scythe came for her again, this time thrown. She ducked. Her head came away cleanly, then slid back into place as her projection reformed without a hitch.
              Hidan yanked on the wire and followed, reeling himself in for a flying kick that passed straight through her.
              Ino turned the motion into momentum, sailing along the root and raising one kunai. She passed through; the kunai stuck in Hidan’s forehead, plunged deep.
              Hidan pulled it free, sneering as he let the kunai clatter uselessly between the roots. “What’s the point of this?” 
              “Nyeeeh!” Ino stuck out her tongue, two fingers briefly lifted to her eye to pull on its lid. She couldn’t, but it still communicated. “Not so fun when it isn’t just you?”
              Hidan answered with his scythe, and the pointless dance resumed.

              Kakashi kept the pressure on; Kakuzu kept giving ground. 
              The thread-golems had split their roles cleanly. The fire-porcupine harassed Shikamaru without respite, while the water-lamprey stayed tight to Kakashi, turning close-range engagement with Kakuzu into a liability. Staying near him meant it couldn’t fire freely without risking friendly fire, but it was a brutally effective melee combatant in its own right. Black thread-arms lashed out, elongating, twisting, striking from impossible angles. It didn’t move like a living thing. Kakashi had to devote constant attention to it – ducking, weaving, leaping– while still trying to stay on Kakuzu’s heels. The golem struck with its hands gathered to a single, sharp point with enough force to shake the ground. With every miss, debris skittered outward.
              Shikamaru’s shadows threaded through the roots, borrowing their darkness, splitting and angling for multi-pronged approaches. It still wasn’t enough. Kakuzu kept one eye trained on them at all times, and with the space the golems bought him, Shikamaru could not gain on him enough.
              A fire-blast tore the earth open in front of Shikamaru, flames licking up and catching on his jacket. The porcupine followed with a swipe that grazed his cheek, drawing blood. His concentration slipped; the shadows shrunk and collapsed. 
              “Kakashi!” Shikamaru shouted, ducking another swing. “This is a problem!”
              He wasn’t wrong. Kakashi dipped below a thread-arm meant to impale and reached up, lifting his forehead protector. When he rose, his sharingan spun into place. 
              Shikamaru kicked off a root and slid beneath the broad-set legs of the porcupine, using its size against it, hands already signing to resume his shadow technique. The sun was still low; the shadows still long. One clean touch and Kakuzu would be frozen. Kakashi had no intention of letting that window close.
              The fire-boar folded forward, reaching between its own legs to seize Shikamaru by the vest. He was yanked before he was even upright.
              “Whoah, whoah, whoah!” Shikamaru yelled as he scraped across the dirt, then flung airborne. He struck a root, failed to catch it, and slammed into a dead, spindly tree that snapped on impact. The porcupine advanced immediately, breathing a carpet of flames Shikamaru had to scramble away from. 
              Kakashi couldn’t afford to look back. 
              A black arm shattered the hard soil before him, stone and dust erupting outward. He let the distance to Kakuzu widen, planting a foot atop the rigid limb and used it as a springboard to tangent Shikamaru’s and – crucially – the porcupine’s vector.
              Behind him, the water-lamprey stooped and drew itself tight, readying another blast.
              Kakashi dropped flat.
              The water burst forward, straight toward the porcupine.
              It didn’t evade. Instead, it roared its own blast to intercept. Fire and water detonated explosively, the clearing flashing bright as heat and pressure collided. Shadows evaporated. Steam billowed, thick and hissing, droplets raining down as the air boiled.
              And Kakashi in the crossfire. He felt the overwhelming power weigh upon him, forcing down.
              Kakuzu had skirted the edge of the blast. Through the fog, Kakashi caught his silhouette as he leapt free, cloak trailing mist. 
              Well. It had been worth a try.

              Hidan’s scythe split Ino cleanly in two.
              She reformed a second later, barely rattled. She tapped a root with a spectral foot and flipped backward as the scythe came through her again, careful to keep her hands clear so her kunai wouldn’t be knocked away. Hidan followed relentlessly, sweeping again and again, dogged in his stupidity. 
              She seized an opening and darted in, slashing his neck. 
              Blood sprayed. She nearly lost her grip, but managed to catch the ring with her pinky, twisting it overhead and into her hand.
              Phew.
              “Kakuzu!” Hidan barked, pausing on the root below Ino’s. He ignored the blood pouring from his neck. “Swap me with!”
              Kakuzu did not respond. 
              As the steam thinned, he reached into his robe and withdrew a third mask. This one was avian in shape, with a clear beak. It did not grow a body of threads; it simply hovered.
              Then it flew off toward the forest.
              Shit. 
              Ino tried to catch Shikamaru’s eye, but he had his hands full with that freaky porcupine thing.
              Trust Chōji. They had planned for this.
              She turned her attention back to Hidan. He was right; this was getting tedious. 
              “Two on one?” she called, forcing a smirk and another flick of her tongue. “I think we can arrange that…”
              The blunt side of the scythe banged against the root in Hidan’s frustration. Ino half-expected a retort, but Hidan saw the two shuriken inbound and snapped his scythe up to deflect them.
              Kakashi was there, behind them. 
              Striking like lightning.
              Steel crashed against steel; kunai rang against blade. The impact split them apart as violently as it had brought them together.
              Hidan twisted, scythe carving a lethal arc. Kakashi signed; the log appeared in his place, skewered in his stead.
              Kakashi did not arrive alone. From the distance, the water-lamprey launched itself like a drawn sling, hurtling toward where Kakashi had just been. Hidan ducked as it thundered past, and the roots groaned and splintered as they absorbed the golem’s impact. Ino recognized what it was doing as it anchored its position, angling downward into the tangle, its maw yawning wide.
              Hidan was busy wrenching his scythe free from the log. Good. 
              Ino leapt. She steadied her kunai with her palm against the ring and aimed for the back of the thing’s head – or the tangle of threads that passed for it.
              The kunai stuck. Weakly. 
              This was not what she was meant for! Gritting her teeth, cursing her immateriality, Ino passed right through the creature, then through Kakashi as he hopped up from the depths.
              “Out ofblrgl–”  The water hit like a dam breaking, drowning her out. She caught a glimpse of Kakashi slipping away at the last second, and felt foolish for worrying about him. 
              Falling to a squat, she tried to brace herself against the torrent on the root. It became slick under her chakra-soles and she struggled – and failed – to keep her footing. Flailing, she focused with her hands as well and caught herself on a lower root, expecting the air to flee her on the impact, but finding it didn’t. At least there was some advantage to incorporeality.
              The waterfall cut off. She looked up, realizing she’d fallen farther than she’d thought.
              Steadying herself – again trying but failing to blow her hair away from her face – Ino leapt upward. She nearly slipped again on the wet roots, and kept climbing until she emerged from the tangle.
              Above her Hidan cleaved the log, shearing off a corner and missing Kakashi by inches.
              Ino was cleaved; by the lamprey. 
              Its arm stretched long as a torii beam, black claws sharp enough to gouge stone. 
              She reformed as she turned, twisting midair, and came face to face with its terrible, circular maw as it opened again.
              Fine.
              Ino would find purchase where she could. Planting her sole against the onrushing stream for the barest instance, Ino used it to flip overhead. Water tore past her, ricocheting off the roots. Droplets scattered, catching the low morning light and bursting into a brief, dazzling spray.
              It rained everywhere. Ino had escaped to an overhead root, but even that was slick now, water sheeting along the bark. Below, Kakashi dodged backward from a scythe throw and found the footing just as treacherous. Wrestling both the log and Hidan at once, he barely ducked the weapon as it cut past his face.
              The blades bit into the cliff wall. Hidan reeled himself in, boots scraping stone as he climbed the flat of the blades, coming to a stop atop the embedded scythe, chest heaving.
              They were nearly at the top. Woodland peeked through above them.

              So far, so good, Chōji thought. 
              He was close enough to hear the distant crash of battle, but far enough away that it didn’t yet concern him. Still, he stood before Ino, arms folded, ready. If anything came this way, it would have to be through him. 
              In these situations it was important to remain calm and focused, even if nothing was going to happen. He stifled a yawn. Soon, this would all be over and they could all return to Konoha. 
              The vulture mask drifted out from between the trees and stopped in front of him.
              Every muscle in Chōji’s body locked. 
              “Shit!” he blurted. “Red alert, red alert!”
              The mask turned and vanished back into the forest.  

              The brief lull ended. The lamprey-golem broke it, either tireless or incapable of rest, as it lunged for Kakashi with its long, thrashing arms.
              Still clutching his log, Kakashi sprang aside – mindful of the slick foothold – before the root shattered and broke beneath the golem. 
              Hidan dropped in from above, scythe raised. 
              Kakashi shoved away the log, creating a gap for Hidan’s blades to pass through, landed on the root on his shoulder, then leapt to catch the log again. 
              Hidan leaned into his overhand swipe, letting the scythe saw into the root. He slid down the handle and to a halt atop the wood, then tore it free and spun, hurling the weapon in a flat, murderous arc.
              Kakashi ducked by inches.
              Hidan reeled himself in for a flying kick. This time, with log before him, Kakashi held his ground, blocking with crossed arms and skidding backward on the slick bark.
              “Come on!” Hidan roared. 
              Ino slid down the cliff-face roots, flowing low and fast. As Hidan twisted to strike again, she passed straight through him, braking on all fours. “Boo!”
              Kakashi was grateful for the opening; he comfortably dodged the scythe and secured his log again. With his free hand he found a kunai and tossed it overhead.
              Ino caught it cleanly.
              Hidan’s attention was split for a heartbeat; Ino used it for everything, going in for the ribs. Hidan couldn’t afford to dodge, forced to watch as Kakashi – then log – came flying at him. The kunai bit; Kakashi stomped Hidan’s throat. As they landed and slid, Kakashi reaching to catch the log, their positions had been swapped in a blur.
              From the edge of his vision, the sharingan flared a warning; the water-lamprey had climbed to prepare another beam, drawing itself tight. This attack was different from the wide, suffocating bursts it had fired before. It took longer to wind. Compressed further. Its circular disc of teeth focused closer. Evade or die. 
              The beam lanced out; a razor-thin, twisting streak of blue. It punched straight through Ino, through Hidan’s chest, and through the log. Kakashi hurled himself backward at the last instant; the line missed the tip of his nose by a hair.
              Again Hidan came in from above, indifferent to the holes in him.
              Kakashi launched the log to muster a dodge.
              Hidan grinned. “Finally taking this seriously?”

              Shikamaru kept running. 
              The fire-porcupine, bristling and flaring, refused to give him a moment’s peace. He weaved and vaulted the roots, hand signing, shadows stretching to pressure Kakuzu.
              It wasn’t enough. Kakuzu gave ground at his leisure, always out of reach.
              Until the log appeared beside him.
              Kakashi swapped to it and struck with enough force to crack mortar.
              They soared together – Kakashi carrying the log’s momentum – and crashed down in the dust. Kakashi drove an elbow into Kakuzu’s neck, pinning him.
              Shikamaru slid to position the bind. The porcupine leaped over him and spewed fire, setting the direct path to Kakuzu ablaze.
              “What?” Kakuzu groaned beneath Kakashi. Threads whipped from his robe, lashing Kakashi and forcing Kakuzu’s rotation. “You want a kiss?”
              At the edge of the clearing, the vulture-mask reappeared. Still. Waiting.
              Shit.
              The threads cinched tight, hauling Kakashi down to the ground. Kakuzu slipped free – and saw the mask. 
              He broke for the forest, through the fire and past Shikamaru. The porcupine followed.
              Kakashi strained against the threads. Shikamaru couldn’t spare the focus to free him. Ino slid in, skidding through the dust to reach Kakashi. The lamprey struck like a meteor, having overshot, then coiled and wound again.
              “Dodge!” Kakashi shouted as the golem lined up Shikamaru.
              It aborted the shot. 
              Instead, it surged after Kakuzu’s trail like a shadow seeking its source. Shikamaru lunged to bind it, too slow by a fraction.
              First the porcupine unspooled, its threads sifting neatly back into Kakuzu’s robes. Then the lamprey. 
              Then Kakuzu was gone.
              Ino hacked at the threads with her kunai; they wouldn’t tear. Instead, she cut away patches from Kakashi’s sleeves and pants. Finally, Kakashi rolled, unfastened his vest, and shed it – most of the threads still fastened to it.
              “Go. Now!” Shikamaru said.
              Kakashi and Ino didn’t hesitate.

              Chōji kept his stance tight, arms raised, eyes fixed ahead. The mask had vanished just as quickly as it had appeared, and it had yet to return. Maybe – just maybe – Kakashi, Shikamaru, and Ino had things under control. 
              Who was he kidding? Of course they did. A sharper pair of minds had never been assembled, and Ino was invulnerable. Everything was fine.
              Kakuzu stepped out of the trees. 
              Urgent at first, then halting. “So,” he said, voice even, “this is where the rats were nesting.”
              Chōji stomped forward. The ground trembled. He signed deer; dog; ox; boar; fox and brought his thumbs and forefingers together in an oval. His form swelled; taller, broader. His torso thickened, his neck compressed. Compact, durable. Fast, despite the mass.
              One palm thrust forward. The other rose beside his head. Legs wide. “The hardboiled egg never cracks!” Chōji declared. 
              Kakuzu advanced. “They absolutely do.”
              Chōji surged forward with crushing tsuppari – open palms – driving, each step stealing space. Fast. Precise. Relentless.
              Kakuzu dipped beneath the first strike. Threads snapped from his sleeves. He brushed Chōji’s arm gently, and the filaments bit in. They wrapped his wrist, coiled up his forearms, and Chōji’s own weight brought him down. He planted hard into the grass.
              Kakuzu vaulted past, using the threads like tension lines, then rebounded with a heel to the back of Chōji’s head. 
              The world rang. Vision smeared. Darkness closed.
              Chōji went limp.

              “See?” Kakuzu said, letting the threads slacken. 
              He turned towards his prize. Stepping past the log, threads slithered down his arm, braiding like a second layer of muscle. They gathered at his fingertips, culminating in a single sharp point.
              Behind him, he heard the apes closing.
              Too late.
              Kakuzu thrust and pierced the girl’s chest, just beneath where her arms had been bound. Blood welled.
              Lightning cracked.
              Kakashi swapped with the log and drove his arm into Kakuzu’s back. Electricity surged through him; Kakuzu spat blood against the inside of his mask.
              He didn’t fall. 
              Instead, he straightened. From within his robes, as Kakashi withdrew his hand, Kakuzu produced a cracked porcupine mask. Broken. Spent. The pieces fell at his feet.
              “One for you, one for me.”
              He turned in a storm. Tendrils seized Kakashi. With a single rotation of thread-reinforced strength, Kakuzu hurled him like a stone. Kakashi smashed against a tree and sailed across the grass.
              Kakuzu walked after him.

              Ino landed as Kakashi was thrown straight through her, her form blurring before reforming. Kakuzu ignored her. 
              She saw Chōji; beaten. She saw her body; open, bleeding.
              “No, no, no–” Her feet shook as she approached. First slow, then fast. She dropped down and forced her chakra to comply, fumbling to retrieve bandages from her pouch.
              “I need to… I need to…” She tore strips, hand trembling as she tried to bind the wound. “I need to…”
              Ino collapsed and dissipated.
