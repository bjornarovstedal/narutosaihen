      content: `Sakura pinched her nose as Naruto dropped from the branch above. He was starting to smell – sun-baked sweat and damp cloth – and he seemed completely oblivious to it. His jacket hung around his waist; his white shirt was stained with dirt and salt. The heat didn’t help. Sakura would insist they find a creek soon.
                “No sign of the tower yet…” Naruto told her and Sasuke as he brushed leaves from his shoulders. “Are you sure we are on the right path?”
                “Yes,” Sakura answered, as she had done again and again. Naruto and Sasuke had spent the first two days sniping over the map; each had gotten them lost in turn, and Sakura had finally assumed sole command of interpretation and charting. 
                Their destination was somewhere south in the Land of Fire, near the border with Tea. Three days at a moderate pace should have brought them close to the center tower of the second test – the landmark they had been told to look for. On and on they went, always expecting to see it after cresting the next hill.

                “Blergh…” Naruto muttered as he shook his empty waterskin. “Keep an eye out for a river or lake, will you?”
                Oh, she most certainly did. Sakura was about to remind him they’d know more once they confirmed their bearings, but Naruto had already sprinted toward the tallest tree in sight to scramble up the trunk. To see the tower or to see lakes – who knew?
                “I see it!” Naruto yelled from the canopy.
                Sakura exhaled. Finally. Now they simply needed to fix their exact position, then find their designated starting location along the perimeter. She crouched beside Sasuke, map spread on her thigh. “Southwest,” she said, checking the sun. Sasuke gave a short nod. Sakura felt a small flicker of satisfaction.
                They found Hagane Kotetsu awaiting them. Sakura only knew him in passing – he was a part of Leaf 11, a team that had been formed four years back. He had been among the observers for the first test. She did not know which exam he and his team had taken to become chūnin, but if she were to guess, it was during the most recent one held by Iwagakure.
                “Woohoo!” Naruto shouted. “We made it!”
                Kotetsu chuckled from the shade of a broad tree. “With about an hour to spare.” He rose, slung his pack over his shoulder, took a few steps, and settled in the grass.
                “Are you not going to explain the test?” Naruto asked. Over their journey, they had plenty of time to discuss and speculate on the details. At first, they wondered if simply showing up at the designated location was the test. They soon concluded that could not be all of it – reading a map was hardly a skill exclusive to chūnin, however difficult said map proved. 
                Kotetsu yawned. “Tomorrow. The test begins in a day. Count yourselves lucky – some of the teams have been here three, four days already. We spaced you apart.”
                Naruto slouched. Sakura felt similarly. After a long trip, waiting around was anticlimactic.
                Kotetsu shrugged. “Get used to it. Most shinobi work is walking, watching, waiting…”
                At least they had time to refill water and hand-fish a proper meal. 

                “Listen up now, I am only explaining this once,” Kotetsu tapped the map. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura leaned in. “Your goal is simple: reach the tower in the center.” A dot on the paper. “From the outer ring to the tower it’s exactly five kilometers.”
                “That’s it?” Naruto blurted “It’s right there!”
                Kotetsu shot him a sharp look. “Let me finish.” He pulled a scroll from his pack – marked with the kanji for heaven. “You need two scrolls to pass: heaven and earth.”
                “And we’re only given heaven,” Sasuke guessed. “So we have to take earth from another team.”
                Kotetsu smirked and nodded. “Correct. By any method short of killing. If you kill – even by accident – you’re disqualified. We chūnin will be patrolling. You have seventy two hours. Three days. Fail to deliver both scrolls to the tower and you’re out.” 
                “So only half the teams can pass,” Sasuke said.
                “At most,” Kotetsu replied. “Some will lose their scrolls. Some will wind up with duplicates. One more rule: do not open either scroll until you reach the tower. If you do, you fail. Understood?”
                They nodded. Sasuke took the scroll.
                Kotetsu rose. “The test starts now.”

                Naruto barely stepped past the perimeter before letting out a loud “let’s go!” Sakura rapped the back of his head with two knuckles.
                “Quiet,” Sakura snarled, “Do you want every other team to hear us?”
                Naruto grimaced, but reduced his volume. “Fine. But we’re going to need another scroll anyway.”
                “Sakura’s right,” Sasuke said. “We move cover to cover. Sakura on the left flank, Naruto on the right. I’ll watch ahead. Do not break formation.”

                Hinata’s heart pounded as they entered the forest proper. The trees rose like pillars; the roots curved like ribs; the canopy smothered daylight until the ground felt submerged. Even at midday, it was dim, humid – claustrophobic.
                Kiba showed no such nerves. Shino’s expression was unreadable as always. Not even timid Akamaru seemed uneasy.
                “We set traps near the tower!” Kiba said too loudly.
                “Lower your voice,” Shino murmured.
                Kiba maintained his leisurely stroll, turning to look back.“Relax. We’re spaced a kilometer apart! If someone’s nearby, they’d have had to sprint.”

                Not quite, Kurokite Kusu thought. Mist 7 had cut across the forest diagonally. Not quickly, just cleverly. The goal had been to intercept slower teams, and now they had.
                “Idiots,” he whispered. So this was Konoha’s caliber. Fodder, plain and simple.
                Far too easy.
                With his hand, he counted down from five for his teammates. At two, something wet touched the back of his neck. He reached – and found a thick, green, mottled leech as long as his forearm. Before he could react, it bit. Numbness spread instantly. His muscles locked. His footing slipped. His scream never made it out.
                His teammates dropped seconds later.

                “Ah – dodge them…” Kiba said as the haemadipsidae fell from disturbed branches above. He hated these creatures. They were one of his main concerns once he learned the location of the test. Staying low and alert was the best countermeasure.
                “Well done,” he said to Shino, whose insects had subtly agitated and driven the leeches. 
                They approached their caught prey – three Kirigakure nin. One had landed directly in the net; the other two lay stiff and shuddering nearby. Kiba used a stick to whack the leech off the closest one.
                “You won’t die,” he said. “The bite’s numbing, not lethal. They’ll drain you dry if left alone, but we’re being generous and removing them. In exchange…” He searched the man’s vest and pulled out an earth scroll.
                “Lucky,” he whistled.

                Naruto heard a scream in the distance. The forest swallowed sound strangely; the cry seemed both close and far.
                “First blood already…” Sasuke said.
                “Do you smell that?” Naruto said, sniffing the air.
                Sasuke and Sakura both tested it. “No,” Sasuke said. Sakura shook her head.
                “Huh.” Naruto frowned. Something metallic… or chemical? Maybe fungal. Hard to tell. He’d never been this far south. 
                They moved on, threading through the roots. The quiet, cautious approach grated on him. It felt passive – like they were waiting to fall into someone else’s trap rather than spring one of their own.
                He shifted, scanning the way he’d been told, and something caught his eye. Low on the next trunk, half-hidden under moss, a sliver of metal glinted. Too small for a kunai. Not shrapnel. A shard of mirror? Some kind of relay marker?
                Naruto slowed to get a closer look. Sasuke and Sakura stepped ahead.
                “Sasuke,” Naruto called quietly, “hold up – something’s–” He had already stepped off the formation line, one foot behind the curving root.
                A faint creak sounded behind him.
                Naruto spun.
                The Amegakure shinobi peeled out of the bark like a shadow becoming solid.

                Grass 1 – Leaf 12 – didn’t have to search long for their first encounter. Their prey had positioned itself neatly. Hana Shiore, Hōzuki Yoroi, and Misumi had started near a river at the southern edge – now they stood at one end of a narrow wooden bridge, facing a trio of Kumogakure shinobi on the opposite side.
                They were an odd group. Two wore masks and white helmets; the third, a man with a scarred eye – older than any genin – looked almost ordinary by comparison.
                Shiore knew what they were. Or, rather, she knew their type. Information brokers. They had begun appearing in the later chūnin exams – never intending to earn a Union-sanctioned promotion, only to observe rookies, gather intelligence, and sell it. To their village, to the Union, or to whoever paid most. Much of that information would end up in future bingo editions. And in this particular exam, there were several noteworthy teams worth cataloguing.
                “Have you ever considered,” Shiore said, “that your leaders are snubbing you?” These three were almost certainly Kumo-issued; too tidy to be freelancers. “Strange, is it not? Kumogakure sends no official teams this year… except you. Preparing their genin for their hosting turn, I imagine. Not that rigging the field is allowed. But home advantage always slips through.”
                This test alone was proof – held in the Land of Fire, on Konoha’s doorstep. Kusagakure’s too, technically, but she doubted her own village had been invited to contribute their choice of location.
                “Work for the hikōshiki and you’d get twice the pay,” Shiore added. The hikōshiki – off-ledger shinobi work – had its own bingo book, black-covered instead of white.
                “Sell the information yourselves,” one broker replied.
                “Oh, we will,” Shiore told them. The opportunity to earn ryō on the side would not pass them by. “Though it’s not our particular trade. Now – shall we battle for our scrolls? We were given earth.”
                “And we were given heaven,” the scarred broker said. “You may have it. We are not here to risk combat – only to observe.” He unlatched his pack, withdrew the scroll marked heaven, and tossed it over the bridge for Shiore to catch.
                “A shame,” she said. “We were looking forward to wetting our feet.”


                Naruto came back smelling of sweat and leaf rot. Sasuke grabbed his collar and hauled him in; the motion was quick enough to unbalance Naruto. “Fool,” Sasuke snapped. “You were told to stay close.”
                “Sorry–” Naruto stumbled. “I had to–”
                Sakura cut him off before he finished; she stepped between them, calm and exact. “It’s fine. Naruto, can you show us the flag?”
                Sasuke paused a heartbeat longer than necessary; that was all he needed. “Yes. Now.”
                Naruto patted pockets, shrugging. His face went sheepish. “Must’ve dropped it earlier. My bad.”
                Sasuke struck him across the face.
                Naruto hit the ground and the illusion split like wet paper. Naruto’s body dissolved, and the ninjutsu peeled back to reveal a shinobi – tan jumpsuit stitched up the middle, cloth covering his eyes, a gas mask strapped tight across his face. The metal plate on his forehead bore three droplets.
                Amegakure.
                “I see,” the impersonator said through the filter. “There never was a flag. Clever.”
                “Do you have a scroll on you?” Sasuke asked. He didn’t expect an honest answer.
                “You are never going to find out,” the boy replied, crushing a canister against the ground to unleash an explosion of gas. It erupted outward, thick and fast, spilling into every depression in the root-woven ground. It rushed around their ankles and swallowed the forest floor. In less than a second, Sasuke and Sakura were nothing but silhouettes in rolling fog. Both held their breath on instinct.
                This was not good; blind, enclosed, terrain against them. Sasuke leapt backward; upward; upward, trying to break above the gas line – but the smoke clung to the bark like it wanted to drag him down. Visibility remained nothing.
                Fine. Force the issue.
                He flashed through the seals – horse; bird; ox; fox – drove his chakra into his lungs, and expelled a sphere of flame. The fireball tore a corridor through the haze and the smoke recoiled, fleeing the heat.
                For a moment, the forest snapped into view. Gnarled trunks, the sheen of the gas, threads of vapor curling like claws–
                –and the Ame-nin, half-merged against a tree trunk.
                Not phasing. Not climbing. Fusing. His outline dissolved into the bark’s irregular grain, body folding tight, breath muted by his mask. If Sasuke hadn’t scorched away the smoke, he’d never have seen him.
                Sasuke’s hand moved before he thought. One shuriken. Direct line. The metal bit into the boy’s chest, flicking dark blood onto the bark before the smoke collapsed inward again, reclaiming the battlefield. Less intense, but still damnably stubborn.
                Still no sign of that imbecile Naruto.
                A sharp thunk struck the wood beside Sasuke’s ear. A fluttering followed, like a fan unfurled.
                Sasuke saw only the silhouette; an umbrella, opened wide… rearing up in a spin. Then the world hissed.
                A rain of needles hailed in a dense, indiscriminate storm. Not aimed – unleashed. Each light, fast, sharp enough to pierce skin but too fine to drive deep. They cut wherever they touched, ripping cloth and flesh in shallow crescents. They were undodgeable. He managed to shield the worst of it with his arms, but several struck his ribs, his thigh, the side of his neck – hundreds of impacts in a single breath.
                It lasted only a second.
                When it ended, Sasuke resembled a hedgehog shaken from its burrow, needles jutting at every angle.
                The smoke thinned just enough to reveal a figure perched on a higher branch, umbrella angled over one shoulder.
                “Well done, Oboro,” the man said.
                The haze continued to thin – slowly, nervously. 
                “Sakura!” Sasuke called out, glancing down to the slope where he’d left her.
                She hadn’t moved. She stood half-crouched against a root, trembling, several needles lodged in her sleeve and thigh. Not lethal hits, but enough to freeze her. Shock. Overload. 
                “Sakura!” Sasuke tried again.
                She wouldn’t move.
                Tch! Not now! There was no time to pull her out of it – not with the enemy closing. Fine. If he was the only one remaining, then that would have to be enough.
                He rose. Drew four shuriken – one between each knuckle – and a kunai. Exhaled. Closed his eyes.
                When they opened again, the twin tomoe of his sharingan spun into place.
                The umbrella-man stood across the roots, the older of the two, shoulders squared, expression almost bored. “You still want to fight?” he said. “Then die tired.” He shifted his grip, turning his umbrella into a yari – straight-headed, long-reaching, meant to skewer.
                Sasuke moved first, whipping two shuriken. The man flicked open the umbrella-weapon and deflected both in a single effective motion, then leapt after him.
                Sasuke retreated along the roots, lashing himself with chakra-binding. The roots twisted like enormous screws around the forest floor; he used them as such, moving from one to the next with controlled haste.
                Umbrella-man followed – and reclaimed the first umbrella he’d planted earlier. Dual-wielding.
                He closed in hard. Sasuke let him, just near enough to threaten without committing. The yari thrust again and again, the points spinning like twisting cyclones. Sasuke stayed barely outside of reach. Getting hit by that meant death. The man hadn’t bluffed.
                He changed roots; the umbrella-man followed smoothly. Sasuke hurled another shuriken. The man snapped open one umbrella to parry, collapsed it instantly, and came on again.
                Growing irritated.
                When they slammed onto the next root, umbrella-man abandoned restraint. He raised the unspent umbrella, the one still loaded with needles, snapped it open, and began to rotate it – faster, pulling the air in. A second storm built.
                Before it could fire, Sasuke dove inward.
                The man jabbed desperately, but he had no leverage while stationary. Sasuke closed the distance completely, came chest-to-chest, to negate the yari’s range-advantage. At an arm’s reach it was unparalleled, but point-blank it was a liability. The umbrella spat its needles in a wild outward burst, unable to halt once wound – but the two of them stood inside the dead zone, untouched.
                The man shoved him off, and the storm expired. They reset.
                A vertical trunk loomed ahead. Corner. Sasuke didn’t drop to the lower roots – he took the wall instead. Upside down again, he ran backward to the trunk and pressed against it, using the brief window to toss a shuriken – wide and without spin. The throw circumvented the need for the umbrella to be employed as a shield entirely. Instead the yari came in hard to skewer him; a tornado, tearing bark and wood asunder, shooting splinters everywhere. Sasuke had evaded.
                Perfect.
                He clenched the thin wire between his teeth and yanked. The wide-thrown shuriken whipped back around like a hooked fish – piercing deep into the umbrella-man’s back. A burst of blood. A grunt of pain.
                Sasuke kicked off the trunk and landed in the leaf-litter below.
                The gas-mask boy rushed him. Sasuke barely tilted aside – the body dissolved into vapor. A clone.
                The real attack came low. Sasuke twisted, drove a heel up into boy’s chin, and let the kunai meant for himself whistle past.
                Oboro tumbled back. Maybe unconscious. Maybe not.
                Sasuke panted, chest burning, lungs tight. Two opponents. Both still moving. His hits shallow.
                This wasn’t sustainable.
                A sting struck the side of his neck.
                A dart.
                Sasuke staggered, hand flying up too late.
                From the underbush stepped a short boy in a dust- and ash-stained suit, a scroll under his arm, a blowgun still raised. Sasuke hadn’t seen him at all – even with the sharingan.
                Above, the umbrella-man shifted position on the branches, slamming one umbrella shut and into the wood.
                “Good timing, Baiu,” he said – not triumphant, just satisfied.
                Sasuke’s vision swam. Heat bled into his limbs. The numbness would follow.
                He turned toward Sakura – still frozen, still half-hidden against the roots.
                “Sakura-”
                His voice broke.
                “Retreat.”

                Naruto came to with a groan, head pounding, cheek pressed into cold soil. Something tugged at his wrists when he tried to move
                “God damnit…” he groaned, squirming. Leather straps. Tight ones. Whoever tied him up had known exactly what they were doing. “Who uses leather straps?”
                He wriggled until he could reach a jagged stone jutting from the ground. Then he worked – sawing up and down, scraping furiously. The sun was sinking as he moved. Orange bled into purple. By the time the first strap snapped, the forest was almost swallowed by night.
                “Finally!” He kicked free from the loosened bindings, rolling once to shake the rest off.
                He got to his feet. Only one thought matter:
                Find Sasuke and Sakura. Pronto.
                Easier said than done… 
                He lit a makeshift torch made from a half-rotted branch and a scrap of his sleeve. The flickering flame barely pierced the dark. Night in this forest was nothing like day; the shadows were deeper, heavier. They clung to everything – roots, trunks, even the air.
                Naruto moved carefully, every step cushioned by decomposing leaves and moss. The forest’s sounds multiplied in the dark. Insects clicked. Foliage rustled. Something slithered across bark. Each noise crawled up his spine.
                He stayed low, but climbed when he had to – perching on a massive, low branch no higher than three meters up. This was as far as he dared. The darkness above felt predatory.
                He scanned ahead.
                Two enormous eyes looked back at him.
                Naruto froze.
                A tarsier – if it could still be called that – clung to a nearby trunk. It was house-sized, arms as long as tree roots, padded fingers working a half-eaten millipede the length of a boat. The overgrown mammal’s dilated pupils swallowed the firelight.
                Naruto inched back slowly. Quietly.
                It didn’t follow.
                Only when he was well out of sight did Naruto snuff his torch, crushing the ember into damp soil. The darkness devoured him.
                He pressed forward blind, hands brushing bark as he advanced. Progress slowed to a crawl. Once or twice he nearly tripped over roots or stepped on something that hissed and fled.
                Then – light.
                A faint glow in the distance. Warm. Red. Flickering.
                Fire.
                Naruto moved toward it – not close, just enough to see. He climbed another root, one that sloped upward like a ramp. From there, he peered toward the glow.
                It wasn’t a campfire.
                It was a ring of fire, burning around a clearing – the aftermath of a fight concluded mere moments ago. Flames licked the woven roots, throwing warped shadows across the ground.
                Naruto swallowed, lowering himself behind the bark.
                Grass 1.
                He recognized them after a moment – the Kusa-nin who’d unnerved them all at their gathering in Konoha following the written test. 
                And the others… Rain, judging by the forehead protectors, but Naruto couldn’t recall their number.
                One, a Kusa-nin with painted lips and eyes slumped against a tree, pressing a hand to a bleeding gash at his side. His breath came in ragged pulls.
                Another – face covered by a stitched, hide-like mask – crouched beside a red-stained kusarigama, drawing it before testing the edge with a calm, almost reverent touch. He reached for his kasa and settled it onto his head with practiced ease.
                A kunoichi stood coiled around an Ame-nin girl, her limbs bending impossibly – contortionist, python-like. It seemed like she was made of rubber, as if there wasn’t a bone in her body.
                Another of the Rain – hooded, bleeding – was struggling, fastened to a tree by steel bolas.
                The last of the Rain-nin, a boy in tattered black robes, writhed on the ground. His leg was crushed and slashed open. Dolls – crude and misshapen – laid beside him, pincushioned.
                “You fought well,” the contortionist said softly. “Your jutsu were… intriguing.” She tightened her limbs around the girl, drawing a whimper.
                “Taking one of us is not a trivial feat,” she continued. “Consider yourselves fortunate. In any other circumstance, we would not leave survivors.” Her tongue extended – far too long – clutching a kunai by the handle. She pressed it against the Rain-kunoichi’s neck, just enough to bead blood.
                “May I flay him?” the masked Kusa-nin asked, lifting his kusarigama as though asking permission to carve a fish.
                “Mmmh… I will permit it,” the contortionist replied. “Only a portion. And stitch him cleanly afterward. We wouldn’t want them to die on us, would we?”
                “Take our scroll!” the hooded Rain-nin said, thrashing against his chains. “It’s earth! Just take it!”
                “This one?” the contortionist asked, raising a bloodied scroll. “We don’t need it. We already have both.” She set it aflame and let it burn.
                Naruto’s foot slipped. A twig snapped – small, but sharp in the crackling quiet
                The contortionist’s head snapped toward the sound, twisting in an unnatural, owl-like turn.
                The masked Kusa-nin paused just before he commenced the skinning, his victim writhing beneath him. “What?”
                “...Wildlife,” she murmured.

                Inside the fallen, dead tree – little more than a hollow husk – Sakura worked fast. She heaped dead leaves over Sasuke until he was nearly completely covered, leaving only enough gap for breath. He had slipped fully into the poison’s grip; delirious at first, then limp.
                Before losing coherence, he had forced out a single truth: she couldn’t freeze again.
                He was right.
                She’d cost them the fight – and possibly everything after.
                But she wouldn’t fail now.
                She had dragged him into the angled trunk, clearing space through damp, rotting foliage. Then came the pressure-point work – precise, uncompromisingly delicate. She slowed his pulse, quieted his breath, stilled the spasms. Not deathlike, but close. Someone would need to look closely to tell he was alive.
                When she had finished, her hands trembled – they still did. One mistake could have pushed him the wrong way.
                Sakura cast kokoni arazu no jutsu over the trunk’s opening, blending bark, shadow, and moss into a seamless false surface. If someone interacted with it directly, the illusion would break – but it would pass a glance test. The darkness draping the forest would aid her.
                She moved to her own hiding place: a shallow depression between roots, covered with the damp leaf-blanket she’d prepared earlier. Before slipping under it, she puffed a faint fūton burst over the soil, muddling her own tracks. 
                Then she lay still.
                Footsteps approached.
                “The tracks end here,” Baiu said – light voiced, breath nervous.
                “Search,” the umbrella-man, their leader Shigure, answered coldly. “It’s a miracle they got this far.”
                Sakura bit down on her own breath. One wrong exhale might give her away.
                Gas-mask Oboro paced near the trunk. “There’s an illusion here…” he murmured.
                “Can you dispel it?” umbrella-man asked.
                “We just need to interact with it. Hold on.”
                They fanned across the clearing. Baiu moved the quietest – efficiently, with practiced motions. Oboro’s breaths rasped. The umbrella-man’s impatience radiated, evident by his hurried steps.
                “The trunk,” the umbrella-man said. “It’s unnatural. Do you agree, Baiu?”
                “Yes.”
                Damn it.
                “It could be to stall us,” Oboro muttered. “A blatantly amateurish trick meant to mislead. That’s what I would do.”
                “We check regardless,” umbrella-man said.
                Sakura’s pulse spiked. She wasn’t sure the illusion would withstand close inspection.
                Then Baiu, the smallest, stepped directly beside Sakura’s leaf-blanket. He was scanning the ground – reading subtle depressions, disturbed moss, bent stems.
                He wasn’t looking at her. 
                But he was seconds from finding her.
                Before she could act, their leader spoke. “He’s here.”
                Baiu jerked upright.
                Oboro stilled.
                “No pulse,” umbrella-man growled. “You killed him, Baiu.”
                “I-I didn’t–! My poison wasn’t lethal!” Baiu’s voice cracked. He genuinely sounded terrified.
                Umbrella-man’s answer was a vicious kick. Baiu slammed into the ground – right beside Sakura, so close she could smell the dust on his cloak.
                “You idiot! Do you know what this means?” umbrella-man said.
                “S–Shigure, I swear – my toxin only paralyzes–”
                “Check again, Shigure,” Oboro told him.
                “I did!”
                They were unraveling. It allowed Sakura her moment of last resort.
                She signed – dragon; bat; deer – crafting a sound, a false sensory echo: the impression of movement deeper in the woods, half-heard.
                Oboro flinched first. 
                Shigure turned his head, just slightly – enough to pull his focus away from the trunk. “The girl,” he concluded. “She has the scroll.”
                Oboro let out a frustrated breath. “We’re disqualified…”
                “Only if they find out,” Shigure said, voice low but still very much furious. “He’s hidden. Move.”
                They retreated – their footsteps fast, uneven, disorganized. Shigure resolute, the other two wary.
                Sakura stayed motionless long after the last sound died, her heart pounding so hard she feared it would burst. Thankfully she didn’t need to maintain the illusion for the trunk, for she did not think she could have mustered the focus.
                She didn’t breathe until minutes later.`,
