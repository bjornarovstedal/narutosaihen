            content: `All the jōnin had gathered in Konoha’s kaigishitsu, the sanctified hall for the meeting between the hokage and the village’s jōnin. Their ranks had recently grown, with Kabuto and Anko joining not long ago, and Kurenai somewhat earlier. Kabuto the traitor was not among them now. Neither were Ibiki and Yamato, both preoccupied by their commitments to Root. Aside from them, all were present. Aburame Shibi, Akimichi Chōza, Nara Shikaku, and Yamanaka Inoichi were among them; so were the twin heads of the Hyūga clan, Hiashi and Hizashi, whose simultaneous attendance was rare. The second-to-last row – Might Guy, Hatake Kakashi, Sarutobi Asuma, and Yūhi Kurenai – was fully present. Together they all occupied a majority of the sixteen mats. Two of the four mats in the first row were vacant; only Hiashi and Hizashi stood before the central pair.
                    The most senior mat belonged to Shimura Danzō, but it would not be sat today. The aged shinobi arrived somewhat belatedly, and instead of assuming his usual place, he ascended – slowly, his gait unsteady – onto the hokage’s mat, facing the assembled jōnin. All remained standing until he spoke.
                    “Be welcome,” he said. <i>“Seiza.”</i> They bowed and knelt.
                    From the small side table before him, he took the agenda. “Firstly, I’ll address the funeral of Hiruzen. Proceedings are underway. The ceremony will be held a fortnight from now. I trust you will attend.”
                    On this, there was nothing to discuss. Many were already involved in the arrangements – either to speak at the service or assist in the logistics.
                    “Next, an announcement,” Danzō continued. “During my tenure as stand-in for the hokage, I will step down as head of Root, so my judgment is not compromised. Ibiki will assume my command. I intend to return to my station once a new hokage has been chosen.”
                    <i>If the next hokage isn’t you,</i> Kakashi thought. He had expected Danzō to pursue the title. And truthfully, he would not be a poor candidate. Though their philosophies differed, Danzō had both the seniority and credentials for the office.
                    “Now,” Danzō continued, closing the topic, “I will hear propositions on measures against Sunagakure and Otogakure.”
                    Hiashi spoke first. "We should agree on sanctions against both. Their transgressions are severe and unprecedented. Any alliance is broken – <i>including</i> the Shinobi Union."
                    “Mmmh,” Danzō murmured. “This will require a summit. I hesitate to call one before Hiruzen has been succeeded, although I acknowledge the matter is urgent.”
                    “We should send an emissary to Sunagakure,” Shikaku said. “Their involvement in the assault was premeditated, yes, but it was on false grounds. The kazekage had been replaced. We do not yet know what the elders understood.”
                    “A wise approach,” Danzō agreed. “Will you go, Shikaku? I shall speak with Ibiki to ensure you have the relevant support from Root.”
                    Shikaku bowed. “I shall do my utmost.”
                    “And what of Otogakure?” Anko called from the back. “Their betrayal was deliberate; they served Orochimaru willingly. We should seize the tanokage and hold him responsible!”
                    Danzō remained composed. “Anko, do not let emotion cloud judgment; your grudge against your former sensei is strong. What you suggest will warrant a full assault on Otogakure – an option to pursue only when all others are exhausted. Deposing their leadership is drastic.”
                    Kurenai bowed. "I agree with Anko in principle. <i>They</i> initiated hostilities. However, covert operations would serve us better than open attack. Their schemes may have yet to end. Otogakure may have more in motion."
                    “I have a proposition, Danzō,” Hiashi said, “one I will discuss in private, if you allow. It is not yet ripe for the kaigishitsu.”
                    Danzō hesitated. “I would rather avoid secrecy, especially since my leadership is only temporary.”
                    “Then I will bring it to the next hokage,” Hiashi said, bowing.
                    Silence settled. Kakashi had nothing to add; the others seemed to feel the same. Their current ignorance made further speculation pointless. Better for Root to unravel the knot of conspiracies than to act abruptly.
                    Danzō let the quiet sit, then rearranged the papers at his side. “Let us discuss the ascension of the exam’s participants to chūnin.”
                    “Still?” Asuma asked, respectfully incredulous. “I would have thought the results voided.”
                    “It was an unusual exam, true,” Danzō said, “but the performances remain relevant. Let at least some good come from this tragedy. The first letter,” Danzō went on, “comes from Otogakure. It concerns their three genin who, if I do not misunderstand, were implicated in the assault.”
                    “A recommendation?” Kakashi asked, genuinely perplexed. He had not expected their sensei capable of such audacity.
                    “No,” Danzō replied. “It stresses they should all be failed. Does anyone disagree?”
                    None spoke, so Kakashi did. “Kinuta Dosu fought my Sasuke in the finals. He performed remarkably.”
                    “And recklessly,” Asuma added. “His jutsu endangered the audience. On that point alone he should be failed.”
                    Danzō gave Kakashi a moment for rebuttal, but Kakashi offered none. He had not intended to argue for Dosu’s passing; only to note his skill. Sasuke had beaten him, even if the victory was less elegant than preferred.
                    “Very well,” Danzō said, dipping his brush before striking the names. “All three genin of Otogakure fail. Next: the three from Sunagakure. All made the finals, though one was nearly disqualified for brutality.”
                    “During the preliminaries," Kurenai added. “Though his opponent attempted… drastic measures.” She did not look toward Guy. “Under normal circumstances they would all pass, even if the girl – Temari – lost her match. However…”
                    “...we cannot approve them given their involvement in the assault,” Danzō finished. “Then it shall be so. All three fail.” Another stroke of the brush. “It is unusual to deny every foreign candidate. What message does it send if we pass only our own?”
                    "What message does it send <i>to assault Konoha</i>?" Asuma said.
                    “True enough,” Danzō acknowledged. “It cannot be helped. Now: recommendations from Kakashi, Asuma, Guy, and Kurenai.”
                    Kakashi raised his hand. "<i>Uchiha Sasuke</i>," he said. "And <i>Uzumaki Naruto</i>."
                    “Naruto?” Asuma asked. “He lost to the Hyūga boy. Convincingly.”
                    They must not have seen the same match, Kakashi thought. “He lacks finesse,” Kakashi said. “But his drive is extraordinary. I did not expect him in the finals. We should not promote on potential alone, but Naruto is… different.” Kakashi was still not sure how to describe it.
                    "Does anyone else here agree regarding Uzumaki?" Danzō asked.
                    Silence.
                    "Then what of Uchiha Sasuke?"
                    Naruto's promotion was unlikely; Kakashi knew that. He was a tough sell. But Sasuke was another matter entirely. "Sasuke exceeds the standard for genin in all metrics. Refusing him would be a disservice to the village."
                    Asuma and Kurenai nodded.
                    “And yet,” Danzō said, “he has been genin only half a year. Perhaps he should mature further?”
                    “No,” Kakashi said – hastily enough to err on disrespect.
                    “Mmmh.” Danzō paused. “I am not fully convinced. But I will heed your judgment. Uchiha Sasuke passes.”
                    Kakashi held a suspicion Danzō would fail him out of spite for the Uchiha name. He was surprised at the lack of fight. Still, he understood the hesitation: the team would benefit from staying together longer. Naruto especially. Their dynamic was rare – mutually reinforcing in ways difficult to articulate.
                    Danzō wrote Sasuke’s name. “Next: Kurenai’s team. Recommendations?”
                    "<i>Aburame Shino</i>," Kurenai said. They waited for Shibi, but the man kept his silence.
                    “Is it true,” Danzō asked, “he was nearly disqualified due to an incident in the preliminaries?”
                    Kurenai bowed her head. "It is. He regrets what happened to the Otogakure boy. But I would not recommend him unless I believed he aspires to the rank of chūnin. His combat ability outweighs his weaker strategic sense."
                    As Danzō considered this, Shibi spoke. "I agree with her reasoning, but not her conclusions. Shino would benefit from remaining genin. I myself spent nearly five years before taking the exam."
                    "Two opinions," Danzō said. "I would normally prefer the parent's evaluation, but we set a precedent with the Uchiha boy. I am inclined to pass your son, Shibi."
                    “I defer to your wisdom, Danzō,” Shibi said.
                    Danzō recorded the name. "Any others from your team, Kurenai?"
                    "None," she said, bowing. Hiashi's daughter was among her students, and Kakashi had in part expected him to speak. Even he seemed to recognize her shortcomings.
                    "Then, Asuma," Danzō proceeded.
                    "<i>Nara Shikamaru</i>," Asuma said. "His combat skills are lacking, but his strategic mind surpasses most chūnin. Keeping him genin is wasteful."
                    Even Kakashi found the endorsement striking – and accurate. Shikamaru's brief match against the Sand kunoichi had been impressive.
                    "Shikaku?" Danzō asked.
                    “I agree,” Shikaku said. “At fourteen he already transcends me. Leave him among genin and he will only sour.”
                    "So decided. Nara Shikamaru is promoted." Danzō made the notation. "Next: Guy's team. They have been genin the longest; by tenure alone they are strong candidates, assuming their performances sufficed. However, it is my understanding that Might Guy has withdrawn from tutoring them. Does anyone else wish to advocate on their behalf?"
                    "<i>Hyūga Neji</i>," Hiashi said. "On my family's honor, he is a generational talent. Grant him chūnin."
                    No dissent followed.
                    "Unanimous," Danzō said. "Hyūga Neji is promoted."
                    Guy remained tense, as he had throughout. At least silence spared Kakashi the effort of arguing against the nomination of Rock Lee, still bedridden and broken.
                    Later, Danzō would draft the formal letters. Each village customarily held an announcement ceremony, where the verdicts would be read aloud. Whether Sunagakure and Otogakure would receive theirs, Kakashi did not know. They would hardly be entitled to them now.
                    “Finally,” Danzō said, drying his brush before setting it aside, “hokage candidatures.” A pregnant pause. “I should state my intentions first. I do not wish to be nominated.”
                    That was a surprise. Excluding the sannin, Danzō was the most qualified on seniority alone. Kakashi had already weighed his vote. Despite Danzō's severity – too uncompromising; too <i>utilitarian</i> – Kakashi's struggled to name anyone better.
                    Guy rose and bowed. “I nominate Hatake Kakashi for the position of hokage.” He paused – long enough to show his nomination was rehearsed, not impulsive. “Kakashi has proven himself at every stage of shinobi life. As genin he advanced with unprecedented speed; as chūnin he completed missions that broke others; as jōnin he has been unflinchingly reliable. His judgment is sound; his leadership steady; his record unblemished.” Guy drew a quiet breath. “He is respected by every village, ally and rival alike. That respect is not born from fear, but consistency. When Kakashi is given responsibility, he shoulders it fully. When he must protect, he protects. When he must decide, he decides.” His voice was measured. <i>Earnest</i>, not theatrical. Still, Kakashi felt this speech was spurred by something else entirely. “Konoha needs stability,” Guy continued. “It needs someone the world already trusts, someone whose loyalty never falters. For these reasons, I believe Kakashi is the best candidate for hokage.” Guy bowed again, lower this time. “This is my nomination.”
                    Kakashi stood and bowed. “I decline the nomination.” Better to do so now, before support gathered.
                    Danzō beheld him a moment, assessing the finality of it. "Very well. Then we must ask; <i>who else</i>?"
                    Inoichi rose. “What of sensei Jiraiya?”
                    "A…" Danzō started, searching for words, "<i>...logical</i> suggestion. I should approach him personally. Hiashi, would you accompany me?"
                    "It would be my honor," Hiashi said, bowing. "But if you would allow me to speak plainly… is Jiraiya truly the best choice? In matters concerning Konoha's interest he has been, at times<i>... erratic</i>. Even lady Tsunade would be preferable."
                    “Is that so?” Danzō mused – perhaps taking Hiashi more literally than Hiashi had intended. However… Kakashi had to agree. Lady Tsunade would make the stronger hokage. “Does anyone know her current whereabouts?”
                    “It is rumored she was last seen in Kusagakure,” Asuma said, scratching his chin.
                    “Then we shall search there,” Danzō said. “That concludes today’s matters.” He rose.
                    "<i>Kiritsu. Owamirasu.</i>"
                    They all stood.
                    “We shall meet again soon,” Danzō said. “Expect my summons.”`

            content: `The door to Kankurō’s chamber opened; not just ajar this time. The anbu, bearing a mask with wicked fangs and downturned eyes, seemed pensive. Almost sad.
                    "You have been summoned to the <i>kizoku-in</i>," the anbu said.
                    The kizoku-in; Sunagakure's go-ikenban, the sanctified meetings between the kazekage and the elders. It was a high honor to have one's attendance requested.
                    Kankurō rose. "When will we be released?" He had asked this question several times now; it made it no less important to ask again.
                    The anbu didn't bother with an answer. The door closed, and Kankurō was left to don his <i>bunraku</i>, the puppeteer's costume of his house.
                    Kankurō then followed the anbu out into the hallway. It was eerily quiet, save the soft brush of the gentle breeze upon the sandstone; the <i>saishi</i> – air priests – still worked, sat on the sills of the open windows.
                    Outside, the sun blazed hot. Summer was just beginning to taper, and this stretch was proving particularly harsh. 
                    They entered the towering, monolithic building in the center of Sunagakure and ascended the winding stairs around its central pillar. When they passed by an opening, Kankurō could see the vast dunes rolling beyond the village. A drop of sweat fell from his nose.
                    Near the top, the anbu let Kankurō pass and assume his position.
                    It was a great, circular slab, lit by the sunroof overhead. From the wall overhead, at all sides and at irregular heights, stones protruded like planks, the wall open at their back. Six seats; only three were occupied.
                    The elders were not clad in the concealing robes their position mandated. Kankurō could see who they were.
                    Chiyo and her brother Ebizō; Kankurō’s own grandfather and former master of the puppet brigade. The third was Jōseki, someone Kankurō only vaguely knew. He was a larger man, even in old age, and as hairy and gray as a wolf.
                    Ebizō smiled warmly. "Kankurō," he said. He spoke slowly; pushing ninety, his voice had gone soft and frail. "Thank you for coming to us. As you can see, the <i>go-ikenban</i> has ceded its privilege of secrecy. Many things will change."
                    So that was why only three of the seats were taken. Naturally, the kazekage’s – the highest one – was vacant. The rest must have disagreed with the drastic referendum.
                    In the light, Kankurō saw the small specks of sand floating around him. The air was dry.
                    As dictated by a long and enduring tradition, there was only one reason the sunroof was open; the kazekage was in attendance. A new one could only be elected at summer solstice, which had come and gone. 
                    “You are here to help settle our indecision,” Chiyo said. She was a squat woman, older than her brother still, but she had retained her edge better. “We will be choosing a new kazekage. What are your insights on Gaara?”
                    Kankurō was stunned. Gaara? Sure, he was the son of kazekage, but–
                    He closed his eyes. His initial thoughts were condemnation. Those were tossed.
                    “Gaara…” he began. “Is changed.” He looked at each of the elders in turn. “He had a confrontation with Konoha’s jinchūriki.”
                    “Uzumaki Naruto,” Chiyo finished. 
                    Kankurō nodded. “In him, Gaara saw…” He tried to weigh his words. “A path forward.”
                    “Our worry,” Ebizō said, “is that he will suffer more episodes.”
                    “I cannot say for certain he won’t,” Kankurō replied. “But Shukaku’s influence wanes.”
                    “Hmm,” Chiyo surmised, clutching her stick. “When in office, he will be supervised. It is only natural for one so young.”
                    Supervised how? They made it sound as though he would serve as figurehead; kage in name only. “Then-” Kankurō began, but Jōseki suddenly spoke.
                    “We have nearly a year to evaluate,” he said sharply. “A great deal of effort has gone into watering Gaara. It would be a shame to see the fruit spoil on the tree.”
                    “We cannot chase a mirage,” Ebizō said, creaking as he turned. “<i>That</i> is Shukaku.”
                    Jōseki held his tongue. Chiyo and Ebizō fell quiet. 
                    “Thank you,” Ebizō eventually said. “That will be–”
                    Kankurō stepped forward. “What of reparations to Konoha? What have you decided?”
                    “Monetary,” Chiyo replied. “So Konoha may rebuild. Additionally, we plan to volunteer our cooperation in any investigation, as well as our forces for any action against Otogakure should Konoha deem it necessary. Nothing will repair our standing, but we will do our utmost to regain what we can.”
                    Before Kankurō could reply, Jōseki cut in again. “Will there be anything else?”
                    The three of them beheld him.
                    Kankurō refused to shrink. “Open the village back up.”
                    Jōseki groaned as he waved him down.
                    Not long after returning to his chamber, Kankurō and everyone else were released.
